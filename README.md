angular-multipage-boilerplate
=============================

bolerplate for multi page webapp with router in angular, this gives deep links to each page

loads html partials with get requests so you will need a localhost (use mamp, node or whatever you wish)

in one of the html pages that gets loaded there is a button - angular detects this button and logs a message to the console
